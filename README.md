# PYSPARK TUTORIAL
> Comparison of SQL and PySpark code.


## Tutorials

The tutorial examples are available to view in the Jupyter Notebooks in this repository.  You can view them directly through GitHub by selecting the `*.ipynb` files.


## Installation for Local Execution

If you wish to run the examples on your own PC, you will need to have [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or Anaconda Python installed on your machine.

The environment needed for the demonstration can be installed with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/m-matthews/pyspark-tutorial.git
cd pyspark-tutorial
conda create -n pysparktut python=3 pyspark
conda activate pysparktut
conda install -c conda-forge notebook
```


## Running the Tutorials

The tutorials can then be executed by starting Jupyter Notebook, and opening the files from there:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
